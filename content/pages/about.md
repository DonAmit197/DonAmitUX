Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate and experienced Senior UX Researcher and Designer, dedicated to creating exceptional user experiences that solve complex problems and drive meaningful impact. With a deep understanding of human behavior and a keen eye for design, I thrive on crafting intuitive and delightful experiences that bridge the gap between users and technology.
With a strong background in both research and design, I bring a holistic approach to my work. I believe that a solid foundation of user insights is the key to designing successful products and services. By combining qualitative and quantitative research methods, I uncover valuable insights that inform the design process, ensuring that every decision is grounded in user needs.

Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working with a diverse range of clients and industries, including e-commerce, healthcare, finance, and education. This exposure has sharpened my ability to adapt to different contexts and understand the unique challenges each industry faces. I am skilled in conducting user interviews, usability testing, persona development, information architecture, wireframing, prototyping, and iterative design.

Collaboration is at the heart of my approach. I thrive in cross-functional teams, working closely with product managers, developers, and stakeholders to align on goals and create a shared vision. By fostering open communication and incorporating feedback at every stage, I ensure that the final product meets both user needs and business objectives.
In addition to my professional work, I am committed to staying at the forefront of industry trends and best practices. I actively engage in continuous learning, attending conferences, participating in UX communities, and keeping up with the latest research. I am also a strong advocate for accessibility and inclusive design, believing that technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of ability.
